We designed our web application with the hope of having all the bits and pieces of self organization in one place. Virtual Journal aims to provide an easy platform for logging daily moods, tracking habits, writing journal entries, and keeping a thorough to-do list. 

We believe that people's moods tend to take after their environments. For example, if they are in a messy room, they tend to be more stressed or overwhelmed, while if they are in a clean, well-organized space people tend to feel calmer. Taking the time to use our virtual journal is intended to cause the same effect; the simple design of the app along with the self-care that is central to the userâ€™s experience is intended to inspire people to strive to be their best selves. Wherever we could, we opted for the minimal design which also emphasizes functionality; we decided to add a nav bar at the top of all main pages to make navigating the app easier. We decided to have only a single-week view on the habit tracker and mood tracker pages to limit the amount of information present on the screen at a time. Both the habit tracker and mood tracker pages intentionally have today's date in the rightmost position, as we believe past accomplishments are more motivating than upcoming days' empty information. 

The main part of our app is the ability to journal. Journaling can help people achieve goals, keep better track of intentions, track progress and growth, gain self-confidence, improve writing and communication skills, reduce stress and anxiety, find inspiration, strengthen memory, and so much more. We think journaling should be a regular part of everyone's days and it is what made us want to create this app in the first place. The Journal portion of the app is built so a user can have one journal per day. The journal can be updated and edited throughout the day, however a user cannot update or delete journals from the past, similar to a real journal. The old entries exist for users to see where they were at and what they were like in the past.

One large ongoing debate for us as developers of this app was trying to decide if we wanted a calendar. We spent many hours looking into calendars and different approaches to building them and realized that the time spent developing a calendar would be better spent further developing the bullet journal features of our app. As per feedback from our user tests, we decided to replace the calendar view with a todo list. 

Our information page provides scientific recommendations on how to promote wellbeing in different aspects of life. 

We plan to deploy our app, which will make it accessible via a URL.
